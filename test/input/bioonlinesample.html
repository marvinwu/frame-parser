</ul>

    <p>&#8220;I heard the call to give up all and follow Christ into the slums to serve Him among the poorest of the
        poor.&#8221; &#8211; Mother Teresa.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Mother Teresa gave up her traditional nun habit and adopted an Indian Sari &#8211; white with a blue edge.</li>

            height="229" /> practical and in harmony with Indian culture. The colour blue is associated with the Mother
        Mary. White is associated with truth and purity. The three blue bands represent the three main vows of the
        order.</li>
    <li>In Calcutta, Mother Teresa began an open-air school and established a home for the destitute. She persuaded the
        local city government to donate a dilapidated building she could use.</li>

        string of mobile health clinics</li>
    <li>In 1971, she opened her first house of charity in the west &#8211; in New York, US.</li>

        poverty of the east.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.&#8221; &#8211; Mother
        Teresa (1989)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>She eventually suffered a heart attack and had a pacemaker surgically fitted to her chest. Even after this
        devastating blow to her health, she continued her work for another eight years.</li>
    <li>In 1958, the trademark white and blue saris were specially made in Titagarh by the Gandhiji Prem Niwas for
        leprosy patients.</li>
    <li>In 1950 Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity. A religious order within the Roman Catholic church. It has
        over 4,000 nuns who take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and service to the poor. Its mission statement was
        to serve.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel
        unwanted, unloved throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by
        everyone.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>The life and work of Mother Teresa were brought to the wider attention of the world through a film (1969) and a
        book (1972), <a href="https://amzn.to/2T0gF71"><i>Something Beautiful for God</i></a>, by Malcolm Muggeridge.
    </li>
    <li>Teresa did not seek to convert those she encountered to Catholicism. She wished to bring people closer to God,
        however they understood God.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“‘Yes, I convert. I convert you to be a better Hindu, or a better Muslim, or a better Protestant, or a better
        Catholic, or a better Parsee, or a better Sikh, or a better Buddhist. And after you have found God, it is for
        you to do what God wants you to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Teresa saw herself as a spokesperson for the Vatican; she upheld the conservative teachings of the Catholic
        church on contraception, abortion and opposition to the death penalty.</li>
    <li>Despite her apparent faith in dedicating her life to the poor, she also experienced periods of spiritual
        dryness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Where is my Faith—even deep down right in there is nothing, but emptiness &amp; darkness—My God—how
        painful is this unknown pain.&#8221; Mother Teresa &#8216;<a href="https://amzn.to/2SZH7NV">Come be my
            Light</a>&#8216;</p>
