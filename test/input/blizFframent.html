<p>President Obama meeting Stephanie Decker, who lost both her legs after saving her 2 children from a tornado.</p>
<p>Her house was right in the path of a tornado and as she felt her house being sucked into the vortex, she grabbed her
    kids (8 and 5 years old), ran to the basement and tried everything she could to shield them. Her kids survived, but
    Stephanie would need to amputate both her legs from the damage.</p>
