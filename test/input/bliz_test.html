<p>At the height of the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to document the country in order to
    gain support for government programs. Several photographers were commissioned, resulting in over 180,000 photos.</p>
<p>The catalogue has been maintained by the Library of Congress, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that the photos
    became digitally searchable. The following is a small collection of these never before seen photos.</p>
