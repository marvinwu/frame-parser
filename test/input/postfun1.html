<p>Many of us put a lot of faith in food and beverage manufacturers. But occasionally, the people producing
    our food, and sometimes even the FDA, don&rsquo;t have our best interests in mind when it comes to the standards
    they establish. In some cases, overlooked ingredients can be adverse to our health in a big way. For this reason,
    some countries are a little more stringent about what their citizens consume on the daily, at least compared to the
    United States. </p>\n<h2>This Soda Is Particularly Bad For You</h2>\n<div class=\"picture-container cf\">\n

</div>\n<p>&lsquo;Brominated vegetable oil&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad. But the stuff is flame retardant! The
    ingredient has been used in American sodas since the beginning. But new studies have shown that the mysterious
    ingredient may be related to skin lesions, memory loss, and nerve problems. </p>\n<p>As a result, Coca-Cola and
    Pepsi have pinky-promised to remove the ingredient from all of their sodas. Mountain Dew, on the other hand, still
    boasts the ingredient on every bottle. Europe and Japan gave this ingredient a hard no, even if it cost them the
    famous green soda.</p>\n<p><b>Mountain Dew also has Yellow #5 on its ingredients list. Here&rsquo;s the issue with

</div>\n<p>Few cheeses are naturally yellow. Most are white through and through. But it&rsquo;s no secret that kids love
    bright colors. So to solve this problem, Kraft brightens up its famous mac and cheese with Yellow #5 and #6. </p>\n
<p>The thing with these food dyes is that they&rsquo;ve become notoriously linked to hyperactivity, allergies, and
    increased cancer risk. Kraft swears to do their best to omit these harmful ingredients, but countless other products
    that the dye can be found in has led many European countries to ban the substance altogether.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>Anything that is literally named &ldquo;Pink Slime&rdquo; does not belong in food. That shouldn&rsquo;t even
    be up for discussion. For Canada and the EU, the talk ends there and it is thus banned. But Americans sometimes go
    and complicate things. </p>\n<p>Pink slime is a meat by-product that consists of finely textured beef. The substance
    is added back into the meat equation as a filler that lowers the fat content. The process requires ammonia gas or
    citric acid to kill bacteria, neither of which are regulated and can cause health issues.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>GMOs are all the rage right now, but few people know why that is exactly. The fact that other nations,
    including Russia, have a ban on them has caused some curiosity in Americans. But not all GMOs are created equal.
</p>\n<p>For the EU, the GMO most worthy of a ban was the one that prevents the ringspot virus. That&rsquo;s because it
    has been linked to tumors, organ damage, sterility, birth defects, and, of course, death. Banning the GMO meant
    banning any corn, soy, or papaya from America.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>Chicken is one of the most user-friendly meats. You&rsquo;ll often hear a person refuse red meat for their
    heart, pork for religious purposes, even fish for fear of high levels of mercury. But chicken generally passes all
    of the tests. Except for this one.</p>\n<p>The poison arsenic is fed to US chickens in order to make the meat look
    pinker and fresher. In order to &ldquo;freshen&rdquo; up the meat even more, it is then cleaned with chlorine. Both
    of these components have led the EU to ban American chicken.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>For some, pork is the lowest of the low when it comes to meat. Being that pigs will eat anything and
    everything, it can be a little worrisome to think what might be getting passed down to the consumer. But the real
    danger of pork is not the pig&rsquo;s fault at all. </p>\n<p>A drug called ractopamine is given to pigs in order to
    reduce their fat content and increase protein synthesis. Our fears about their consumption are validated by a study
    that showed 20% of ractopamine remains in the pork being sold in the store. That number is so high that US pork has
    been banned in 160 countries! </p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>Speaking of food dyes that mess with the body, blue dye is among the worst. Before getting into the potential
    side effects of consuming the pretty die, it is first important to know that the dye is derived from petroleum.
    That&rsquo;s the stuff we put in our gas tanks and also is what creates the asphalt we drive on.</p>\n<p>Banned in
    Norway, Finland, France, the UK, and Austria, this dye may contribute to hyperactivity, brain cancer, and nerve-cell
    degeneration.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>M&amp;Ms are a world-wide sensation, and a part of that may have to do with their willingness to tweak their
    ingredients to adhere to varying laws and regulations. America, as you probably could have guessed, is pretty much
    fine with whatever. Here, the candy currently still contains blue dye, which we previously deduced is not great.</p>
\n<p>The red ones also contain a carcinogen called amaranth. When this was discovered back in 1976, the red ones were
    omitted long enough for the public to get over it. American M&amp;Ms are strictly banned in Europe.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>The EU is very high maintenance when it comes to its rice. They practically banned basmati rice in 2017 with
    an order that manufacturers drop levels of the pesticide Tricyclazole down to a hundredth of its previous legal
    limit. </p>\n<p>On top of that, the EU has also monitored the amount of arsenic in their rice. Arsenic is that
    poison we feed to our chickens. Currently, America allows both chemicals but does regulate Tricyclazole, allowing
    only three parts per million.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>That shiny, waxy layer on the outside of apples doesn&rsquo;t naturally occur in nature. In fact, organic
    apples actually have skin that&rsquo;s a bit rough. Since apples are a fruit that&rsquo;s eaten with the skin on,
    manufacturers decided that people would pay more attention to their look than to any added ingredients.</p>\n<p>The
    shiny skin is caused by the pesticide DPA, or diphenylamine. While more research is needed to confirm a correlation
    between this substance and cancer, concern was enough to cause Europe to ban American apples entirely.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>Carrageenan is a filler that is extracted from seaweed, which sounds like it&rsquo;d be healthy for you.
    After all, any leafy green is bound to be ridden with vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, some researchers have
    found the substance to cause issues in the digestive system, ranging from inflammation to IBS to colon cancer.</p>\n
<p>Tests conducted on mice found that the compound caused the development of glucose intolerance and impaired insulin
    response. Carrageenan is now banned in the EU, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop Americans from using it in chocolate
    milk, ice cream, soy milk, beer, and veggie burgers.</p>\n<p>

</div>\n<p>Recently, we&rsquo;ve been seeing milk cartons sporting &ldquo;no rBST&rdquo; on the front. That&rsquo;s
    because the hormone has been used in the past to increase milk production. Unfortunately, doing so is terrible for
    the cows, causing health conditions like mastitis.</p>\n<p>Mastitis is basically inflamed breast tissue, but with
    all the high demand for dairy, cows don&rsquo;t always get a proper recovery time, almost guaranteeing an infection
    to ensue. The milk then becomes infested with antibiotics and pus. Due to that horror, Australia, New Zealand,
    Canada, Japan, and the EU have banned all dairy products from the US.</p>\n<p>
