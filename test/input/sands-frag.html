Nurseries almost always plant their succulents in soil that's way too dense and <a href='https://www.succulentsandsunshine.com/best-soil-for-succulents/'>retains too much water.</a> The more of this nursery soil you're able to get rid of, the healthier your succulent's roots will be.</p>\n<p>You may not be able to get all the soil off without damaging the roots, and that's totally fine. Just get rid of as much as you can while being gentle on your succulent.</p>\n<p>If you're planting your succulent by itself (as I am here), you'll want to leave the roots intact as much as possible. On the other hand, if you're putting together an arrangement with several succulents, you might want to break off some of the roots.</p>\n<p>Getting rid of some roots won't create any big problems&#8211;your succulent will survive just fine either way. And, if you're lucky enough to have babies attached to your main plant, now is a good time to remove them if you'd like.</p>\n<p>The succulent I'm using here is a &#8220;<a href='https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=potting_gollum&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F230664514%2F4-succulent-gollum-jade-ogre-ear%3Fga_order%3Dmost_relevant%26ga_search_type%3Dall%26ga_view_type%3Dgallery%26ga_search_query%3Dgollum%2520jade%26ref%3Dsr_gallery_2' target='_blank' rel='noopener nofollow sponsored'>Gollum Jade</a>&#8220;.</p>\n<div id='attachment_5974' style='width: 745px' class='wp-caption alignnone'><img aria-describedby='caption-attachment-5974' class='wp-image-5974 size-full' src='https://www.succulentsandsunshine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remove-as-much-soil-as-possible-before-potting-your-succulent.jpg' alt='Remove as much soil as possible before potting your succulent' width='735' height='1103' data-pin-description='Planting succulents in containers is much easier with the instructions in this post!
