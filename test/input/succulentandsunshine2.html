It's a temporary arrangement, but it's perfect for a baby shower, bridal shower or any other event! Plus, the succulents can be used again or planted elsewhere when you're done.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>It would be fun to mix in some cupcakes too if you were using it for an event such as a wedding or bridal shower. It would make a great table centerpiece!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a shoe</h3>\n<p>Who would have thought of planting succulents in old shoes?

Plus, if you give it a little sunshine and water it will keep on growing!</p>\n<p>Use <a>hot glue</a>&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<a>wide ribbon</a> around the hat to create a base. Once it is set in place, add a row of “<a>greenery</a>.” You can use hot glue straight on the ends of the <a>cuttings</a> to attach them to the ribbon.&nbsp;Use a variety of succulent sizes, and glue them to the ribbon.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>I've had a few people ask me how to care for the hat once it's created.&nbsp;<a>Water</a> it like you would any cuttings. Soak it every few days, and let it dry before wearing it.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><img></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Centerpieces</h3>\n<p>Over the years, I've had many opportunities to photograph some incredible succulent centerpieces. Use the pictures below for inspiration for your next even or party!</p>\n<p>Cindy Davidson of <a>The Succulent Perch</a>&nbsp;always has the most fun arrangements! I love this miniature succulent garden! You could create your own using <a>cuttings</a>, <a>miniature garden accessories</a>, <a>spaghnum moss</a>, and a <a>planter</a>!</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Laura Eubanks from <a>Design for Serenity</a> created this amazing arrangements with succulents in a large <a>conch shell</a>! You can do the same by putting <a>spaghnum moss</a> inside the shell, and adding <a>cuttings.</a></p>\n<p><img></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a wooden box</h3>\n<p>Use the idea of <a>thriller, spiller, filler</a> to create a beautiful succulent arrangement in a wooden box that you can use to decorate your home. It's simple, easy and fun!</p>\n<p>To create your own wooden box arrangement,&nbsp;fill the bottom with a little bit of <a>succulent soil</a> and then cover it with <a>Spanish moss</a>. The moss&nbsp;gives the <a>wooden boxes</a> a little bit of interest and also help stabilize the cuttings and keep them in place.</p>\n<p>You can also use <a>rooted succulents</a> for an arrangement like this too.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in Glass Votives</h3>\n<p>These fun succulent-filled votives would make a great addition to wedding centerpieces or decorations!</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Fill glass <a>votive candle holders</a> with&nbsp;<a>colored sand</a> and add your&nbsp;<a>succulent cuttings.</a></p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Your succulent is not likely to thrive very long in this cute little centerpiece.&nbsp;While it may last for a few months (watering a tiny amount once a week: you don't want water to build up), your succulent will be happiest if transplanted after a little while to a pot that has more room for it to grow.</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Cuttings Planter</h3>\n<p>To make this planter, just get some <a>PVC pipe</a> in a variety of sizes and voila!</p>\n<p>Use a&nbsp;<a>multi tool</a> for sanding and sawing.&nbsp;I would recommend using a <a>1″ pipe</a> to allow for bigger leaf cuttings and more room to grow). Cut your PVC to the sizes in various sizes, and sand the edges. <a>Glue</a> the pieces together to create the planter shape you want.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Then simply use <a>spray paint</a> to make it the color of your choice!&nbsp;Once your paint is dry you'll want to fill the pipes the rest of the way with succulent soil.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Once the dirt is in, fill the pipes with your <a>succulent leaf cuttings</a>!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a book</h3>\n<p>This is such an easy project!</p>\n<p>First, cut out a square about 3/4 way through an old book. Glue the pages together by pasting glue all along the outside of the book. Line the inside of the square with <a>plastic</a> so it won't get soggy.</p>\n<p>Add <a>spaghnum moss</a>, and place your <a>succulents </a>inside.</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>DIY Driftwood Planter Filled with Succulents</h3>\n<p>With this <a>step by step tutorial</a> you’ll easily be able to create a stunning piece of driftwood decor filled with succulents for your home. You only need a few supplies!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><a><img></a></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Chevron Plant Riser</h3>\n<p>This project is a bit more time consuming, but is well worth the effort!</p>\n<p>First, you'll want to create a drawing of how you want the riser to look along with the measurements.&nbsp;Measure and mark the boards so you know exactly where to cut. After you measure, go ahead and make the cuts.&nbsp;Next, piece them together to make sure they fit properly. Then screw it all together!</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Next,&nbsp;<a>spray paint</a> two coats of yellow over the whole riser. To create the&nbsp;chevron stripes, use&nbsp;<a>masking tape</a> to block off the shapes after the paint has dried. Then spray paint again with the base color to prevent the top coat from bleeding. After putting the tape down, paint over the top with the second color of paint and wait for it to dry.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img>Once the paint is dry, paint a second coat and waited for it to dry again. Then pull off the tape to reveal the beautiful chevron!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a wire planter</h3>\n<p>To start, you'll need&nbsp;2 <a>cocount liners</a>. Attach the liners to the planter using <a>floral wire</a> and loop it around one of the wires then securing it on the inside.</p>\n<p>To attach the <a>cuttings</a>, use <a>scissors </a>to poke a hole in the coconut liner.</p>\n<p>Once the cutting is in the hole, take a small piece of wire and insert it into the cutting perpendicular to the stem, as close to the liner as possible. This prevents the cuttings from falling out (a very crucial step).</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Next,&nbsp;fill the planter with <a>well draining soil</a>&nbsp;and then add in some larger plants. And that's it! Fill in any gaps you see with smaller plants until you're happy with the result.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Wreath</h3>\n<p>Learn how to make a <a>living succulent wreath</a> with this step-by-step photo tutorial! This fun DIY&nbsp;project is sure to make a statement on your front door!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><a><img></a></div></div></li><li><div><div><a><img></a></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Holiday Garland</h3>\n<p>To make this holiday garland, you'll start by making the base. To do that , attach a bunch of <a>Portulacaria afra</a> branches together using wire. You could also use any <a>leafy jade variety</a> to create the same effect.</p>\n<p>Next, cut short pieces of <a>wire</a>, overlap the end of a couple branches, and wrap the wire around both branches.&nbsp;Loosely wrap the wire around two branches. Continue to do this until you have a strand the desired length.&nbsp;Continue attaching together cuttings until you have a long strand.</p>\n<p><span><img></span>\n</p><div></div><div></div><div></div>\n<span><img></span><p></p>\n<p>After the base is ready, attach a few more individual branches of the <a>Portulacaria afra</a> in different varieties to the base.</p>\n<p>To attach the base to the mantle, use&nbsp;<a>3M Command Hooks</a>&nbsp;and wire. Put the Command Hooks horizontally on top of the mantle (rather than vertical like you would on a wall). Then wrap a piece of wire around the garland base and then to the hook.</p>\n<p><span><img></span>\n</p><div></div><div></div><div></div>\n<span><img></span><p></p>\n<p>Once you have the base in place, start adding other succulents to the garland. Use wire to attach the other cuttings to the garland base.&nbsp;To finish off the garland, pick out two somewhat large succulent cuttings and used them to cover the Command Hooks on the sides.</p>\n</div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>DIY Painted Planters with Succulents</h3>\n<p>These <a>bell&nbsp;cups</a> are so easy to personalize&nbsp;and look great with succulents in them! In just a few minutes you'll have a fun new planter for your succulents!&nbsp;You can jazz up these cute planters in just a few minutes. They'd make great gifts too!</p>\n<p>You can do so many different things with them: add <a>gold leafing</a>, use a <a>metallic paint pen</a>, <a>paint</a> them bright colors – the options are endless!</p>\n<p>To prep the cups, just make sure they are clean and have a hole in the bottom for water to drain out. I used an <a>awl</a> to poke through the holes that were already in the cups and made them slightly larger.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Once you have all your pots decorated the way you'd like, it's time to fill them with <a>succulents</a>! The pots are small enough you likely won't need to add any extra soil. Just put the whole plant in!</p>\n<p>After you have the succulents in, add the <a>top dressing</a>&nbsp;to cover the soil. This is one of my favorite parts of the project actually! It adds a finished look and feels modern and chic. The rocks will also prevent soil from coming out as easily when you water.</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent terrarium</h3>\n<p>Terrariums are all the rage these days, especially succulent terrariums. Learn how to make your own with this <a>step-by-step photo tutorial</a>. Plus learn some dos and don'ts for using succulents in terrariums!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><a><img></a></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>DIY Succulent Jewelry</h3>\n<p>If you're looking to create some&nbsp;jewelry that will make a statement, this is the project for you! These stunning succulent earrings and ring are easy to make and sure to catch people's eye!</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>You'll want to use small succulents for these, such as&nbsp;<a>White Diamond Stonecrop</a>, <a>Crassula ‘Tom Thumb,'</a> or&nbsp;&nbsp;<a>Cremnosedum ‘Little Gem'</a>. If you've been <a>propagating succulents</a> from leaves, those baby rosettes would be perfect!</p>\n<p>To make the earrings, put a dab of <a>floral glue</a> on the <a>earring post</a>. Next, gently place the succulent on the glue. Pull it off slightly and press back down to help the glue dry faster.</p>\n<p>If the succulent will stay in place upside down, that is the easiest way to let the glue dry. Otherwise, you can hold the earring until it dries (a minute or two if using <a>Oasis Floral Glue</a>), or place it in pebbles or <a>foam</a> to hold it upright until dry.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>To make the wire ring, wrap <a>wire</a> around the <a>ring mandrel</a> on the desired&nbsp;size.&nbsp;Once you have a thickness you like, cut the wire. Wrap a smaller piece of wire around the main part of the ring to keep everything secure. Once you have that done, you can start gluing on succulents!</p>\n<p><img></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><p>For larger <a>earrings</a> like these, you can adhere <a>reindeer moss</a> to the earring. Then attach the succulent cuttings with floral glue as well.</p>\n</div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a rain gutter</h3>\n<p>If you're looking for a way to store a lot of succulents in a small place, try creating a rain gutter garden! They are large, relatively inexpensive, don't take too much soil, and have enough room for succulents.</p>\n<p>These would look great on the side of a shed, under a window, along a fence, or on the railing of a balcony.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p><a>Cut</a> the rain gutter down to the size you'd like it, then&nbsp;place an <a>end cap</a> on each end. <a>Drill</a> holes all along the bottom to allow for proper drainage.&nbsp;Use <a>caulk</a> to seal the gap between the gutter and the end cap.</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Once the caulk is dry and the gutter is attached to the wall, fill it with <a>well-draining soil</a>. Then let the fun begin! Arrange your succulents however you'd like in the rain gutter.</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulents in a&nbsp;Himmeli pyramid</h3>\n<p>If you're looking for a simple way to add interest to the succulents in your home, this Himmeli pyramid is the perfect project for you!</p>\n<p>Start by cutting the <a>brass tubes</a> in half with a&nbsp;<a>tubing cutter</a> so they are 6″ long. (Need some help with cutting? <a>This video</a> is a helpful guide)</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Once you have the brass tubes cut, <a>cut</a> a long piece of <a>wire</a> (at least 35″). String 5 of the tube pieces&nbsp;onto&nbsp;the wire.&nbsp;Place the tubes so all their ends touch with no loose wire between them. Create a triangle with 3 of the pieces (including one of the end pieces) and wrap the wire around itself to secure the triangle.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Create a second and third triangle out of the other pieces of tubing. Thread the wire through the pipes, secure it, and trim off any excess before placing over your succulents!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Cold hardy succulent rock garden</h3>\n<p>While I love planting in traditional pots, I love planting in more unique containers as well.&nbsp;This succulent <a>rock garden</a> is a great way to make a statement in a small space. This really is a great option for college students or anyone living in a small space.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Fill your <a>planter</a> with 1/4″ rock &nbsp;like <a>Monto Clay</a>. It absorbs water and drains well. It's also a very similar color to the rock so you don't need to use a <a>top dressing</a> to finish things off.</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>You could add&nbsp;<a>cold hardy succulents</a> so you can leave them outdoors year round, although they would also look great indoors planted with a <a>Haworthia</a> or something that tolerates <a>low light</a>.</p>\n<p>This <a>mini garden tool set</a>&nbsp; works well for sliding soil into hard to reach places.&nbsp;Make sure everything is packed in tight, brush off any stray soil or dead leaves and you're good to go!</p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Easter Decorations</h3>\n<p>These simple Easter decorations will take 5 minutes or less each to create! Use items from around your home, such as a <a>mini trifle dish</a>, <a>ceramic plate</a>, and <a>egg tray</a>!</p>\n<div><div><div><ul><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li><li><div><div><img></div></div></li></ul><div><span></span><span></span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Use a little <a>moss</a>, your favorite <a>Sedums</a> and&nbsp;<a>Sempervivums</a>, and any other accents you want. It's so simple, but I love how it looks like a little fairy garden! Now all it needs are some <a>fairies</a>&nbsp;and <a>mushrooms</a>!</p>\n</div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Succulent Pumpkin Centerpieces</h3>\n<p>Succulents are so much fun to use with pumpkins!</p>\n<p>For this look, cut off the top of a <a>craft pumpkin</a> and drill holes in the bottom. Fill it with <a>well draining soil</a> and <a>succulents</a> just like you would any pot or planter.</p>\n<p>This arrangement can last for months! Plus, you could also spray paint the pumpkin <a>white</a> or <a>gold</a> to keep it around for Christmas and New Year too!</p>\n<p><a><img></a></p>\n</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><span><img></span><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><p>A more traditional approach for succulent pumpkins is to <a>glue</a> <a>moss</a> and <a>succulent cuttings</a> to the top.

What could be better than a succulent filled <a>cornucopia</a>? Fill your cornucopia with <a>spaghnum moss</a> (hint: soak the moss in water – it makes it much easier to work with!).</p>\n<p><img></p>\n<p>Nestle your <a>succulent cuttings</a> into the sphagnum moss, starting at the bottom.

Add <a>succulent plugs</a> to <a>mini tin pails</a>. Most will fit perfectly without adding any extra soil, although you may need to&nbsp;add soil to a few.
