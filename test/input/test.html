<p>Condoms just don&rsquo;t stretch to hold large objects; they can also fit smaller belongings, such as sprinkles. It
    sure is a colorful way to remind one of the sweeter side of sex!

<p>George Martin is a huge football fan, and he couldn&rsquo;t resist slipping some references to the New York Giants
    into A Dance With Dragons. Martin wrote, &ldquo;The galley was also where the ship&rsquo;s books were kept &hellip;
    the fourth and final volume of The Life of the Triarch Belicho, a famous Volantene patriot whose unbroken succession
    of conquests and triumphs ended rather abruptly when he was eaten by giants.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re familiar with
    the New York Giants at all, then you&rsquo;re likely aware that this is a clear reference to their Super Bowl
    victory over the New England Patriots who were previously undefeated.

<h2><strong>Pat Robertson on Feminism</strong></h2>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Robertson is active with a lot of political groups, but is not technically
        considered a politician. He is most well-known as the leader of the Christian Coalition. At the 1992 Republican
        National Convention, Robertson preached to a sea of people &ldquo;Feminism encourages women to leave their
        husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.&rdquo; Robertson
        was actually then rewarded for his comment with applause from the crowd.</span></h4>
