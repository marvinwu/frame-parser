    style="--fontSize:25; line-height: 1.33;">Watering</h5>
  <p>Anacampseros rufescens has typical watering needs for succulents, but is sensitive to
    over-watering. It's best to use the <a href="../../how-to-water-succulent-plants/index.html">“soak and dry”
      method</a>, and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings.</p>

    style="--fontSize:25; line-height: 1.33;">Where to Plant</h5>
  <p>Anacampseros rufescens is not cold hardy, so if you live in a zone that gets colder than
    20° F (-6.7° C), it's best to plant this succulent in a container that can be brought
    indoors. It does well in full to partial sun.</p>
  <p>Plant in an area of your garden that gets 4 hours of sunlight a day. If planting indoors,
    place in a room that gets a lot of sunlight, such as near a southern-facing window (if
    you're in the Northern Hemisphere).</p>
